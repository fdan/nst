nuke to do:

* implement in ml server/client (hardcode num styles for now)
* wrap in gizmo to allow automated writing of inputs
* send to farm button creates a job with two tasks types:
    1. cache input images to disk from nuke (1 task per job)
    2. run the headless oiio nst job from yaml, using the cached images (1 task per frame) (temporal smoothing an option)


down the track a c++ implementation of core could be worth considering if commercial distribution became an opportunity.
having said that I'm obliged to write up my findings so possibly not alot of point in hiding the source code.
