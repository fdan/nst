dev to do

* finish temporal coherence

nice to have's:
* ability to cancel once started (should be possible with batches)
* caching of inputs on server to avoid repeated prepare

...

milestone descriptions

milestone 1:
* nuke user can work at a proxy resolution, which combined with mlc live update give a reasonable response time
* nuke user can lookdev at proxy resolution, then send to farm for full res on cpu
* limited to single style, but can use style alpha, target map
* nuke user can adjust quality via several parameters (epocs, mips)
* utilisation of various debug outputs (activations, gradients, pyramids, style-only nst) for assisting lookdev
* demonstrate in a video

milestone 2:
* nuke user can combine multiple style images
* substantially demonstrate the quality and variety of possible results

milestone 3:
* temporal coherence of farm jobs using ruder et al
